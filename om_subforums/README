Subforum extension already exists for punbb forum, it is made by Putnik:

https://github.com/putnik/punbb_subforums

Putnik made a really great work, thank you :). His extension is focusing on version 1.3 of punbb.

My extension is basing on his work - i am using the same file structure (it was fast, clear,
just good). Everything else I have made myself - I have rewritten 95% of source code and test it.

Source code is much simplier than the one from putnik. I don't allow to create multi-level nested
subforums - only one level is allowed. The subforums are shown on the index page in one line
separated by commas or in the list of topics.

I have tested this extension with every possible scenario - changing category of parent forum,
changing parent, deleting forum, deleting category, etc.

enjoy.
